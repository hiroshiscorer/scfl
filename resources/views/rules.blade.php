                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>Welcome to the Star Cross Fighter League rulebook, which specifies the conditions and processes of tournament operations, conduct, requirements and administration requirements of competitors and staff.
                </p>
                <p>This web based rulebook is to be considered the latest version.</p>
                <ul class="numbered">
                    <li><h3>REGISTRATION CONDITIONS</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Team roster can consist of a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 players, a minimum of 3 players must be registered before round 1. </li>
                            <li>Teams may make alterations to their roster at any time under the following conditions:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A player may be added to a vacant roster position at any time (Note though conditions of Section 2)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>A non-locked player (see 1 b iii) can be removed from the roster or replaced by another player.</li>
                                    <li>Once a player has played a game for a team they are locked to that team's roster for the duration of the season.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Teams will no longer apply for Open or Classic. This will be replaced by a multiple division scheme. The amount of divisions will depend on the amount of registered teams.</li>
                            <li>Division drafting in season 4 will be made based on historic data from the players in past SCFL events. In following seasons, the teams will be drafted based on the latest season performance.</li>
                            <li>Teams will be verified by SCFL staff. Teams are required to check in with staff on the discord server before the event commences.</li>
                            <li>All participants must have joined the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/BgYknw7bUu" target="_blank">StarCross Fighter League Discord server</a>.</li>
                            <li>Teams must name a team captain or representative that will be the point of contact for that team.</li>
                        </ul>

                    </li>
                    <li><h3>ROSTER ROTATION</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All rostered players of a team must play a minimum of 2 games (or 1 round) during the season.</li>
                            <li>A team that fails to field a player without reasonable cause or notice will have 3 <strong>LEAGUE</strong> points subtracted for each player in this situation (e.g. Your team has 5 pilots, but only fielded 3 of them, then 6 points are deducted).
                            </li>
                            <li>2a and 2b apply to the <strong>LEAGUE</strong> format only.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>STRUCTURE OF SCFL</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>SCFL will be divided in two phases, first a round-robin league format (<strong>LEAGUE</strong>) and then an elimination tournament format (<strong>SHIELD</strong>).</li>
                            <li><strong>LEAGUE</strong> will be split in divisions to try to match teams with similar skilled opponents. This phase will be played using round-robin to determine each division <strong>LEAGUE</strong> CHAMPION. Each round is to be played in a week by week basis.</li>
                            <li>Winners of each division will be determined by number of points. If tiebreakers are needed these will be KD ratio, then total kills and lastly the result of their match. If ties persist, a die will be rolled to break the tie.</li>
                            <li><strong>SHIELD</strong> will be held with special settings. This elimination phase will try to include as many teams as possible, starting from the top ranked teams in <strong>LEAGUE</strong> standings until a full bracket is filled.</li>
                            <li><strong>SHIELD</strong> will be also played in a weekly basis (one-day events tend to alienate many players, and we want as many players participating as possible).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>DURATION AND PLAYABLE TIME/CONDITIONS OF LEAGUE ROUNDS</h3>

                            </li>
                            <li>Match playing times are flexible arrangements that can be worked out through staff members and team captains, it is the team captains responsibility to arrange and communicate with team and opposing captains then to inform staff when arrangements are made.

                            <li>If a team gives no notice and does not arrive within the 30 -minute time limit, then the round is considered abandoned by the non-arriving team and is declared a forfeit (under conditions of 10a) of the round by the non-arriving team with all 6 points of the round being awarded to the team that is present.
                            </li>
                            <li>No more than 2 rounds at any given time by one team are to be postponed to later rounds. If a team extends to a third round being postponed the earliest round under postponement will be declared a forfeit under conditions of Section 10 a.

                            <li>HOME / AWAY TEAM DETERMINATION AND RIGHTS
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The Home and Away teams are decided by a coin flip carried out in server by a bot or by using the <a href="https://trandom.zyp.mx/" target="_blank">TRAndomizer</a>. The winner of the coin flip is the home team.</li>
                                    <li>The Home team will decide with which faction to play first. The factions then alternate on the following game.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The Away team will decide in which map to play first.</li>
                                    <li>Home team then chooses the map for the second game.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>LEAGUE POINTS SYSTEM <br>
                                Teams will be awarded points during the league phase based on the following game outcomes: <br>
                                3 points for a game win by more than 5 kills (e.g. 20 - 14, 20 - 10)<br>
                                2 points for a game win by less than or equal to 5 kills (e.g. 20 - 15, 20 - 18)<br>
                                2 points to each team if there is a game draw (e.g. 20 - 20, this may happen if you are 19 - 19 and there's two deaths almost simultaneously) <br>
                                1 point for a game loss by less than or equal to 5 kills<br>
                                0 points for a game loss by more than 5 kills <br>
                                <br>
                                For clarity, when the game software declares a winner, the game is over, the final on-screen score is then assessed to determine league points. If points are even on the game scoreboard then a draw will be declared.
                            </li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Home team is decided by coin flip carried out in server by bot or by using the <a href="https://trandom.zyp.mx/" target="_blank">TRAndomizer</a>. The winner of the coin flip is the Home team.</li>
                                    <li>The Home team will decide with which faction to play first. The factions then alternate on the following game.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Both games will be played on the same map. The map MUST be randomized using the <a href="https://trandom.zyp.mx/" target="_blank">TRAndomizer</a> by a staff member or caster (see below). </li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Before starting the match, a staff member or caster should share their screen via discord and open the <a href="https://trandom.zyp.mx/" target="_blank">TRAndomizer</a></li>
                                    <li>Once both team captains are watching the shared screen, the caster or staff member will roll 3 random craft builds for New Republic, and 3 for Empire.</li>
                                    <li>Both teams should take note of these 6 random crafts and loadouts, as those are the loadouts that will be used in the games.</li>
                                    <li>Teams are free to choose which pilot will fly which loadout, as long as the three loadouts are used.</li>
                                    <li>When switching faction, the teams MUST fly the corresponding mirror loadouts. That means, they will fly the loadouts previously played by the opponent.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>If there is a tie (Both in-game scoreboard values are even once added), then another pair of games will be played with the map and loadouts randomized again. However, this time the match will last 10 minutes, with a 10 kill cap. (Instead of 15 minutes and 20 kills). If the tie persists, repeat the process for another pair of games, randomizing again, but from now on, halving all ship hull and shield modifiers (0.5 for first 2 games, then 0.2, then 0.1).
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Use of identical auxiliary weapon loadouts on both auxiliaries of the same playable ship ("double conc" bug) will be considered a loadout offense and will be declared upon deployment of the ship onto the map.
                            </li>
                            <li>Turret mines - offense will not be registered until a turret or rocket mine is launched by a player onto the map. This rule does not apply for <strong>SHIELD</strong> tournament phase.</li>
                            <li>Rocket mines - offense will not be registered until a turret or rocket mine is launched by a player onto the map. This rule does not apply for <strong>SHIELD</strong> tournament phase.</li>
                            <li>When conditions described in 9 a, 9 b, or 9 c occur, the offending team will automatically forfeit the game under conditions of Section 10 a with the game ceasing immediately.</li>

                            <li>In the event of a forfeit being declared the forfeiting team will receive 0 league points for each game forfeited and the opposing team will receive 3 points for each corresponding game .

                        <ul>
                            <li>League length will be determined by the number of rounds, which are in turn determined by the number of teams in each division.
                            </li>
                            <li>Divisions will have a minimum of 4 teams, and a maximum of 7 teams; always targeting an ideal of 6 teams per division. If uneven teams are signed up, then the higher divisions will house the additional teams. (e.g. If we have 11 teams, then it would be 6 on the higher division, and 5 on the lower one.)</li>
